This program can function as either:

- an online customer interface
- a retail store interface
- a file input stream for usage records

online customer interface:

Like with all of them you will be asked to input your oracle username and password. After that you’ll be asked if you are a new customer. If you are you’ll be prompted and intuited into the system. After that you’ll be taken to the customer menu. You can update your info, delete accounts or disconnect phone numbers, view usage records, or make an online purchase

retail store interface:

After entering your oracle username and password, you’ll be prompted to enter a store id. One that works is 9912232

Retail store interface gives you two options. You can either make a sale, which functions in the exact same way as the online store sale

or

you can check unit inventory and order more if you see fit.

file input stream for usage records:

after entering in your oracle username and password, you’ll be prompted for an input file name. Enter ‘SampleInputStream.txt’. Then you’ll be prompted for an output file name. You can enter something like ‘errors.txt’ i don’t really care

After that it will read throug the file, if it exists, input the valid usage records and, and write the errors to the error file
